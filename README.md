# Blockchain using GoLang in Hyperledger 
Implemeneting Blockchain Technology in Music Industry with IBM Hyperledger Tool with Golang. This was my first Block chain project. The query, permission file are all simple. I have created music files as documents and hashed with a particular ID. When there is a trade of music files the author of music files doesnt change no matter what, hence even after n trades the payement will be directed and copyrights will belong to the actual author irrespetive of the number of distributions it goes through.
